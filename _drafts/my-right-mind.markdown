In 2012 I played World of Warcraft 10 hours a day and ate a medium Papa Johns pizza once every two days; I also happened to skip 90% of my college classes (and coursework) that semester. I made a similar choice three years later. 

Was I really entitled to continue indebting myself by $20,000 a semester? It's scary to think I had the power to do that.

Let's use a less extreme example: 

Are we the result of an average of decisions or a few key decisions? What happens if we make a decision when we wouldn't consider ourselves at our best? What is our best?

For starters, binning a decision for some time.

Secondly, talk it out.

Thirdly, writing it out.
