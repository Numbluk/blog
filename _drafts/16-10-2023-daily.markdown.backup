# October 16th

I'm in my office on Crouch Road,
Listening to Nagrand music and ambiance,
And it's around 10:18 PM:

The sway of life is almost comical from a distance. The smallest of anonymous comments: "Any hiring in India is a shrinking of the UK and Poland. Take note UK so that the company doesn't have to run another redundancy process. Leaving while you can.". If only Blind didn't get to me. Even if the commentor is only expressing an opinion, it does sow the seed of doubt. Doubt, that thing which is terrible to shed. The prime example is Sally: "Well, I've heard that AI is going to put software jobs at risk. So much risk, in fact, that people are recommending against it as a path for young people"â€”the thoughts and concerns this surfaced afterwards! If someone with no industry knowledge has the capability to plant the smallest seed, then how can I protect myself from anyone with actual experience?

Will my career be steady? Can I provide for my family? I hate tech, that much is true, but at least it pays the bills. All I want is a secure and enriched future for my kids. I don't see the UK giving this to me or my children.

Tonight was a stressful one, especially for Caroline. The girls were running and laughing constantly, throwing the dirty clothes everywhere in the kitchen even after time-outs. After serving food, Caroline became so smitten with anger that she shut Frances, a three-year-old blonde angel, outside, at night, and in the cold. My immediate response was disbelief, but on sudden realisation it was, "What the fuck are you doing?! What the fuck?!". Caroline brought her back in after three seconds, however, I made damn-sure she knew I was not okay with what happened and checked again that she knew it was wrong. I will never see that happen to a child again in this household. If you are so upset by the sound of children giggling mischievously then keep yourself locked away in the other room. I will watch closely. There will be no circumstance where I'm forced to revisit the worst circumstances of my own childhood. I am their protector.

In other news, I was able to wake up at 6:45 AM and begin work on the the book by 7:05 AM. I'm still not through Chapter 2, however, I am working my way through the problems. The problems themselves are helping to highlight topics which should stick out from the chapter's contents. Once again, I must gripe about the serious lack of definitions in the book and paid-only access to answers. To complete the book without the internet is a fool's errand.

As I mentioned earlier, the seeds of doubt are strong, especially when it comes to the future of writing as a craft. Obviously, AI cannot write a Hemingway now, but can it in the future? Does it matter? Seeing something so unique to the human spirit be taken away and trampled on is sad beyond belief. Unfortunately, the
