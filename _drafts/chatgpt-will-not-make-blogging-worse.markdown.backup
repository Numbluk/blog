title: "ChatGPT didn't kill the writer, Google did" or "ChatGPT and Google are both thieves; but Google killed the writer"

- Introduction: Good content has always been hard to find. When is the last time you Google'd your favourite recipe and the first result was exactly what you wanted? When was the last time you found a blog that left you with a feeling of, "wow, this is great content". Unless you know exactly what you're looking for, I'd hazard a guess that you probably haven't run into this in a long time. And Google is to blame.
- Let me take you on a walk through some popular subreddits on blogging. Both communities I reference are in the top 1% of subreddits and contain multiple instances of very successful bloggers sharing their stories and answer questions (make sure to reference with a link). What does this look like to you? It's gaming Google's ranking algorithms at a price: quality. 
- How did we get here? The devil is in the details and most notably Google's SEO tactics:
	+ SEO keyword optimisation
	+ Rewarding output over quality: the author's themselves didn't write a lot of this content! Show comments about how many people didn't write their own blogs.
- The price: Show examples of good and bad blogs
- The price: sameness. Without fail, every food blog I land on has the same terrible anti-consumer structure: 10+ photos that take forever to load and cause the reading experience to be thrown off because the page height grows as I read, terrible writing about "tips" and "history", and ad after ad after ad. This is not the internet I want. I would happily pay for good content (shout out to SeriousEats and AmericasTestKitchen and GreatBritishChefs). In fact, I'm willing to pay for good writing as well: I genuinely like the stories behind the food, but not when it's half-assed content churn with repeated keywords for the sake of ranking hire in Google's food chain.
- A lot of these blogging communities are the same: they try and churn out content that tries to follow a magical SEO formula with no discernable difference between other blogs that do the same thing.
- So what's the difference between an army of third-world writers churning out "content" in comparison with "ChatGPT"? If we are talking purely about the end result, then nothing. At the end of the day, the blog owner reviews it, makes changes to keep the voice consistent, and ultimately decides if it gets published. In essence, once the magical SEO formula was out of the bag, content farms sprung up and wreaked havoc on our ability to find good content. the content farm has killed good content and Google just pressed on the accelerator. 
- It's a hard problem and will likely never be solved.

- ChatGPT is just like Google: you can never fully trust it. So in essence, it's no different.  Dissimilarly to Google, it steals the content that it learns from. 
- Selection of what is good will always be a hard problem because it requires a . It's why ChatGPT won't kill mailing lists. I'm willing to trust an opinion of someone who sifts through mounds of articles to uncover the good ones.
