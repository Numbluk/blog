---

- Intro:
	+ WoW, cost of college
	+ This is a huge decision for a 19-year old kid. 
	+ How could I make a decision like this when I wasn't in my best mind? What is my best mind? How do I keep my best mind?
- The group
- The individual
- The internet
- The writing
- The waiting
- Be true to yourself: It's okay not to certain things
- Conclusion:
	+ The flipside is that the best decisions I've made have been done in the same way

In 2012 I played World of Warcraft 10 hours a day and ate a medium Papa Johns pizza once every two days; I also happened to skip 90% of my college classes (and coursework) that semester. I would hazard a guess that I'm not the only one who has made a similar mistake. I made a similar choice three years later. 

Was I really entitled to continue indebting myself by $20,000 a semester? It's scary to think I had the power to do that. "The system" aside, it's scary to think I was so easily making a decision which would impact my future children.

Playing World of Warcraft may seem innocent enough for a college kid, and sure there were some good memories, but let me tell you that I only look back on it in horror. It's the flashback where a friend pulls you back from the road before a car zooms past or the catch of a branch before slipping and falling 50 feet onto a pile of rocks. What could I have been? How close was I to living a life of regret without any success? Speaking of regret, I surprisingly don't have any, only a strong willingness to not repeat the same mistakes.

My personal decision to spend more time playing video games was a symptom, not a cause. In fact, it took another very expensive, yet similar mistake to finally wake up to this mess.

It's now a priority in my life to avoid making the same mistakes, and so far things have turned out okay. 

The most important thing I've concluded which drives success are my peers. If you are alone everyday, struggling through the slog alone, bearing the discipline alone, and having to constantly choose between the easy path and the hard one then having a group of like-minded people is the best thing you can do. The relationship is symbiotic, you feed opinions and feelings to the group and the group feeds them back: sometimes they may throw your opinions back in your face or tell you what an idiot you are for even thinking of quitting, but that's okay. Remember, this is a group that strives for an ideal even if it's difficult, so they aren't going to push too far beyond your limits. Being open and communicating is necessary here. You cannot lie. Remember, if you lie you are not caring for yourself or the group. 

Funny enough, over time I've found that the best groups do not have to be in person. Dedicated online forums to your interests can be a minor replacement for what you're lacking in real life. As an example, I used to have physical goals, bench three plates, squat four, etc, but there are very few people in life who genuinely care about such things (especially in the UK) and I didn't have the time to dedicate to hanging around like-minded guys at the gym because I lacked the time. In this case, Web 2.0 forums were my saving grace: a group of people chit-chatting about various programs, but everyone trying to hit the ideal of physical perfection in their mind. It helped me stay on the wagon when things were tough and solidified the "you are what you eat" mentality.

In-person will always be better because in-person interactions carry much more weight. A face to face conversation three times a week far outweighs perusing the internet for an hour a day; the steady cadence is critical. And even better is a daily interaction with the group. I cheat because I'm lucky enough that my workplace is this group for me. My closely related(???) peers at work is a group of individuals who want to be the best and do not have an ego. Not everyone is in this situation and it's difficult to make this a situation when the work environment is cut-throat and there's little room to grow.

This is why human enterprise is a beautiful thing. Humans feed off the success of others and it pushes themselves to reach further and further until we look back and realise we went further than we ever expected.

Without a group, find a friend or at the very least someone who wants the best for you.???

Let's use a less extreme example: 

Are we the result of an average of decisions or a few key decisions? What happens if we make a decision when we wouldn't consider ourselves at our best? What is our best? How do you prevent yourself from heading down that way in the first place?

When I look back at my life, my greatest achievements came off the back of a discipline to see something through even when it was hard. 

For starters, binning a decision for some time.

Secondly, talk it out.

Thirdly, writing it out.

I would recommend publishing thoughts in the open with a special emphasis on the process: write, edit, edit, edit, publish. Writing, for starters, hammers thoughts into shape and makes us realise what a mess they initially are with the caveat that they can be fixed. Editing is where the magic happens. Editing is smelting: it draws out the refined thoughts and gets rid of the fluff and aimless directions. Editing turns a mess of words into a work of art. Most importantly, editing takes time and it's this time that forces us to think about and finish our thoughts. Am I on the right track? Is this way off the mark? Once edited, then, and only then, should writing be published. Strangely enough, society is okay with criticizing spur-of-the-moment feelings, but when it comes to well thought out arguments it takes time to rebuttal if you truly care about finding the essence of what you're saying. Rarely will anyone write slop onto a page and publish it; people tend to care about how others perceive their writing. After all, writing is highly personal and criticism can be a hard thing to face. 

If you are uncomfortable with making your thoughts public, then I would consider journaling. Journaling is second best primarily because there is a lack of review. The process of publishing writing forces you to review what you think rather than scratch the itch of putting thoughts to paper. Am I against journaling in general? No. When I look back over the past four years I can trace my life's ups and downs through a journal of thoughts and it's funny how many times my anxiety panned out to be nothing in the end. This, alone, is entertaining to read and has helped me overcome certain aspects of stress, but it's not a substitute for keeping yourself on track.

Fourthly, find people who want the best for you.
