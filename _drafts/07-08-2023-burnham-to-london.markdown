Rice & Cole Boatyard, Burnham-on-Crouch - Chatham Maritime Marina, Chatham

The trip started well enough, we were off the pontoon a half hour after 09:00, it was partly cloudy, and everything was pushing us except the wind. Phil asked us some critical questions which I either struggled to have answers to or had an even worse answer, "no": "have you tested the depth of the depthometer?", "did you bring along a jerry-can of fuel?", "I'm off to use the loo, I hope it works".

It wasn't long before we realised the sea-cock for the head was completely locked in the off position. For the rest of the trip we had to get inventive (or desperate) through a cup, sink, or other such means of transport. Sailing is not made for pessimists. 

Once we neared the edge of the sand flats, we sailed most of the day. By the time we arrived in Chatham at 17:30 took down the sails and were welcomed by a castle across the marina's entrance. On berthing, we headed off into the shopping area located closely to the marina. The networking for the marina door was currently under test, so we had to find someone to let us in. It's nice to be in a marina where civilisation is nearby and we can find tools, KFC, and bubble tea.

Sadly the tools didn't relieve our toilet situation which meant Midnight Lady had to come out of the water to be fixed as soon as we got home, or as soon as us men wanted to avoid aiming into a sink heeled over at 20 degrees or you women needing to be even more inventive at the same angle.

The first night of a sailing trip is typically the roughest. You've had a long day--when you're sailing when is it not?--but you're not so tired that you can sleep through the awkward bedding.

Chatham Maritime Marina, Chatham - St. Katharine's Docks, City of London

There is something special about St. Kat's. 

Maybe it's because even at Â£80 a night, which means it's likely to be one of the most expensive marinas in the country, it's still the cheapest night you'll ever have in Central London. 

Maybe it's because it's the most central you'll get with a yacht unless you can somehow manage to pry open Tower Bridge and take down your mast(s) as you head further up the Thames (the life of a Thames Barge is glamorous).

But is sure isn't the trip there.

Remember, the roughest night is the first which very well means the the second day of sailing trip is typically the roughest. You didn't sleep the night before and you will likely wake up much earlier than the day you set off as a result and you will likely leave early with the tide, which is always an hour earlier than you'd like to be ready for.

Out and down the lock from Chatham, we are steady on the Medway. We very nearly run aground for not paying attention (high tide looks deceptively high!). Luckily a last-second glance gets us back on the right side of a Napoleonic fort and out of danger.

Heading into the Thames channel from the Medway can be scary with the large container ships zipping past you and the ones just in the distance ready to pounce at a moment's notice. Channel markers are your friend in the Thames; that, and the almanac. Pilotage into the Thames requires staying out of the way of much larger ships and towing vessels and avoiding what seems like an endless array of obstructions. Cutting corners will leave you high and dry, so read the almanac!

The wind is not good for us on this day. We motor for most of it. As we are in front of the World London Gateway Port, perhaps the worst name of any port, Phil asks another sensible question: "Did you fill up a jerry can of diesel?"
"No", I replied.
"Tsk tsk, naughty boy", said he.
It's funny how you try and live up to the expectations of people with a lifetime of experience, but ultimately fail to do so. You don't realise how important it is ensure seemingly mundane things are tracked and completed. Lesson possibly learned.

Continuing our way under the Queen Elizabeth II ("QE-2") Bridge, chatter of protestors blocking off the entirety of England's Southeast comes into being. No matter. They're up there, and we're down here.

"I imagine all those people in those cars up there are looking down on us in jealousy", Phil says. I can't help but agree.

Caroline suggests the sails go up, and so they go. We can finally drown out the sound of the diesel engine. It's a great feeling.

You can start to tell we're nearing London. Construction, warehouses, and a growing skyline of International Style architecture creates a dead zone all the way from the QE-II bridge until the Isle of Dogs. I'm astonished at what developers in England get away with when it comes to housing; their creativity starts at high-rise apartments and ends at "glass or concrete?" In fifty years these buildings will be colonies of slums.

The Eastern edge of London City Airport brings a relief because it "looks" like the London I know, but even more exciting is the Thames Barrier. The closer you get to the Barrier, the more your VHF lights up with the London VTS (Vessel Traffic Services) directing everyone through an open barrier: "Please head through Span D please". Going through the Thames Barrier made me think of what the Fellowship experienced as it went through the Argonath. The Thames Barrier's purpose as the last wall of protection to protect most of London from certain destruction really puts you in your place--it is certainly a feat of engineering.

Next up is the O2 Arena and the Isle of Dogs. With Canary Wharf staring down on us, it's hard not to gape at the fact that you can sail down the arteries and right into the beating heart of this  metropolis. As much as I wouldn't, I'd love to experience it again, but at night. Passing along the eastern side of the Isle of Dogs, I'm reminded of how neon vomit is allowed to be constructed. I can imagine the architect justifying his modernist style with its juxtaposition against the old Greenwich housing and the reflective skyscrapers will allow it to rise to the heavens and take its place among the great places to live in London. If only people weren't starved for choice. Caroline chimes in with the very difficult question of, "would you rather live in this beautiful Georgian housing on this side of the river, but have to look at _that_ or would you rather live in _that_ and look at the beautiful Georgian housing?" I wager the architect lives in the back row of the Georgian homes, out of sight and out of mind of his monstrosity.
