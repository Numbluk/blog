There is a balance that must be struck between the Great Fronts: God, family, exploration, notoriety, and wealth. What is most important must be decided because achieving all five is not possible.

First, God. I've failed, but I still have to try. Maybe this is the missing key? The worries, the concerns, maybe it will all go away. A life at peace with the world could allow me to achieve all five of the Great Fronts. God must be found and a put above all else.

Second, family. Aside from God, family have thus far dictated all else. The biggest upcoming costs are nursery, but private school constantly hangs over my head. Is it worth Â£200,000 per child? I'm not so sure. But finding a way to enforce a sense of tradition, culture, pride, and value in hard work must be found.

Thirdly, exploration. I can't explain the want to sail. There's something out there on the horizon. It's the mix of skill, danger, and Mother Nature which drags me out to sea. In any case, I want to dedicate time to it. I truly believe it has value in more ways than one and could potentially be a solution for my girls' upbringing and the crowd they are around.

Fourthly, notoriety. This one is interesting as it is a kept secret, but to a great extent I value my voice being carried. There are many ways to achieve this, but perhaps the biggest solution of them all is to write a lot and improve over time. Overall, more time is needed.

Fifthly, wealth. I need money for all the above, but how much? How much should my family struggle in the short term to reap the not guaranteed benefits of the long term? I don't fancy retiring early, but I need money for a larger house, a larger boat, and to help my children, but once again: how much? Do I need a mansion? Are there sacrifices I can make? I'm concerned about the availability of my career in the long run in a remote world. If this happens, am I willing to sacrifice time with my children for wealth? Corporate wealth will not bring me God, notoriety, exploration, but it could help my family an amount which I'm still uncertain as to what.
