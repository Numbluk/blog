title: "The Beauty of Constraints"

Goal: Explain why limiting yourself in life results in progress and beauty.

When I walk inside a shop I struggle. I will stare at the candy aisle for ten minutes trying to find a candy bar I will devour in one. I'm hungry, I feel the rush of reward flooding my brain telling me it's worth it when it couldn't be a worse investment of my time. One might blame this on my sugar addiction, but this issue is even worse when it comes to something a little more grounded: vegetables.

Vegetables are the ultimate choice multiplier. In fact, at my local shop in a town of 10,000, there is probably more than fifty varieties of vegetables. Even if we take the absolute minimum combination of one vegetable having the ability to combine with five other vegetables to make a dish, we are talking 250 variations of dishes. When we start talking about more complicated dishes and adding in herbs and spices to the mix we are easily reaching thousands of variations. How is one to choose?

Constrain your choice. With candy you could choose chocolate-only bars, or 70%+ chocolate, or heaven forbid nothing at all. Vegetables are a little more difficult to pass over if you want to eat well. In our day and age we have grown accustomed to having vegetables of a season in all seasons. In England, we have cucumbers in the winter, leeks in the spring, purple sprouting broccoli in the summer, and spring onions in the autumn, but none of this is local(?). For everything there is a season except our ravenous appetite for selection, however, the beauty of selection is that you can choose to have less of it.

I recently gave up buying produce from chain market stores now and buy directly from the supplier: farms. Each week, my produce is delivered in the form a cardboard box on my doorstep. Everything, or at least _almost_ everything (oranges will admittedly not do so well in England), is organically grown five miles away from where I live. You might think this is only for the middle classes, however, I almost never buy organic produce from a chain store and have found little difference in the amount of money I spend each week there compared with a chain store. In fact, I've found that I spend less because I'm not bombarded with sales on biscuits, ice cream, and crackers all within an arms reach. 

The reason I mention this is because I've now severely limited in the best possible way. I'm limited by the great limiter: Mother Nature. What vegetables I decide to cook each week is defined by a few variations which appear as a result of the magical combination of a farmer's hard work and whatever nature throws at them. Rough winter? Looks like we're eating more kale. Long drought? Looks like we're eating more carrots.

Harvest seasons don't change on a dime, so I happily receive many of the same vegetables over a period of weeks. My lack of choice means I'm forced to explore the beauty of specific vegetables in all their forms. I have less stress, less choice fatigue, and eat healthier.

You could accomplish the same goal by buying only a single ingredient or looking up what's in season in your local area, however, that's more effort than I'm willing to put forward (never mind my perceived farm to door benefits). 

This applies to almost every area of life where selection and growth are limitless or even grey. I constrain myself to short-form writing to have a quicker feedback loop, I voluntarily don't work overtime because to force good prioritisation skills, and I force myself to wait before making big purchases to see if I really care enough to buy it two weeks later.

A key improvement I've noticed is a greater appreciation of the things I do. I acquire less, appeciate more, and feel less stressed. 

Mr J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt describes this about eggs in his seminal work The Food Lab:

I now cook with the seasons. I use this as an example because it's an example of limiting myself to remove the cost of making decisions.
