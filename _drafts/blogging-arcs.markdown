I came up with this idea when covering the reason why I don't write novels. I began to write that, "novels have one primary arc and you stick to it" and that this wasn't the case for short-form writing. I'm going to experiment with arcs, or series of blog posts on the same topic to help out with sticking to a goal and writing towards it. I won't do this at first because I need to learn to capture 500 words at a time to form a story, but I will in the future.
