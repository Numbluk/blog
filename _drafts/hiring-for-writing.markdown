I wish engineers treated writing like programming, a skill to be learned.

Writing is difficult. Writing is hard. There are no types in prose, nor auto-generated snippets. If I read a technical document which is unclear and unorganised, then I can almost always guarantee that the background project is not going well. How could it? Writing is a translation of thoughts. Shoving incoherent thoughts on a page is like babbling about your future holiday(?): you have no idea where you're going and there's little to define until you do research.

The impact of bad writing only gets worse as you go up the chain.

A junior engineer's scope is limited to their team. Here, bad writing, like bad PRs, have a small audience. A staff engineer's scope, on the other end, is multiple teams and sometimes large parts(?) of the company. A staff engineer's bad writing slows down *teams*, and oftentimes leaders of those teams. 

How can we be okay with such a low bar of quality? After all, managers, whom you'd hope would have better-than-average writing skills, are setting the hiring bar. Firstly, the blame rests on managers who think that "okay" writing skills will be outshone by algorithmic superiority. This is a lie. Secondly, the blame rests on recruiters figuring out that many engineers shy away from writing challenges. Thirdly, bad writing is hard to quantify and therefore a hard sell to upper management. People need to care about writing as a qualitative measurement rather than a quantitative one. 

If it were up to me, I'd prefer engineers who are eager to communicate well. 

Maybe my expectations are too high, or they're wrong. 

Why is it so difficult to hire a good engineer who is also a good writer? Personally, I blame the hiring process and hiring managers who think that "okay" writing skills will be outshone by algorithmic superiority. This is a lie.

I've found that encoding good communications skills, as in *good* communication skills, encourages engineers to treat it seriously. 

If everything were up to me,
