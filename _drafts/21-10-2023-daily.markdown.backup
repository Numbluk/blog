# October 21st

I'm in my office on Crouch Road,
Listening to nothing,
And it's around 3:14 PM:

I've been thinking about my fear of being forgotten and the gulf between my blood and the rest of the world. I suppose part of my quest here is to make a mark on the world while I'm alive, rather than twenty years after I'm dead.

But does it matter? If I'm dead and with God, does anything I've done here matter? No, it doesn't. I suppose it may be nice to see change while you're alive, or see how people interpret and become influenced by the worlds you create, but the genre I'm interested in isn't exactly high literature. Then again, I think about all the boys of my age who were influenced by the Fantasy genre and realise that Tolkien and Lewis have moved more people than Steinbeck and Fitzgerald.

It's the stories I'm interested in after all. My want to write has to do with this fear of being forgotten only in part. My true interest is in world building and crafting stories which move audiences. 

And is all of this thinking pointless? Possibly, and the more I think about it the more important the point becomes. Sailing was an interest and a serious passion until the fear of death become overwhelming (I have a lot to lose after all). And perhaps with sailing, there is still time to overcome this fear. But with writing, I should take the same route. Test it. Test the passion. See if I enjoy it. If I hate it, then this makes the problem less difficult and I don't have to moan so much about whether or not I'm making the best decision or life or if I have enough time to study to become the next C.S. Lewis.

I originally put off participating in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) because I thought it'd be a worthless time sink, however, I firmly believe it's the best way to test if I'd be seriously interested in pursuing writing as a hobby. If I quit, or push through until the bitter end and hate every step of the way, then the way is clear: sailing it is. If not, well, I'm going to learn to love grammar over the Christmas period and January. I will add, that one benefit of NaNoWriMo is I'll be able to have something to reference in terms of comparing my writing ability and its improvement over the course of next year. I can consider this my "first novel", even though the bar is incredibly low and will in all likelihood be terrible.

Not too long ago, Dad told me not to ask God for the right choice, but to be directed. I did ask God and way is now clear. Thanks be to God.

What this means is I need to sort out a few things before November 1st which is eleven days away:

1. For "A Student's Introduction to English Grammar":
	1. Finish taking notes for Chapter 2.
	2. Read through Chapter's 3 and 4.
	3. Take notes for Chapter's 3 and 4.
	3. Do the problems.
2. Figure out how to use and download Scrivener.
3. Come up with an idea of what to write.
4. Come up with a writing style to facilitate speed.

50,000 words or 1,667 words per day in November here I come.

Note: I need to find another place to house this blog. Working with Markdown isn't ideal in certain situations such as quotations and avoiding line breaks or large line spaci
