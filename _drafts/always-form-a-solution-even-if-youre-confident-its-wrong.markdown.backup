title:  "I Always Form A Solution Even If I'm Not Confident It;s The Right One"

Once a team grows beyond ten people, reaching consensus is difficult. Sitting in a team meeting, someone who has a direction in mind will ask the team about a problem without giving away their position in the name of impartiality. What ensues is a meeting that was supposed to be a "quick 10 minute catch up" is now lasting half an hour, an agreement has been made to have all sides represented in a collaborative document, and a final meeting will be had to come to a decision.

This attitude of impartiality slows the team down.

Consensus typically implies medium to large decisions and when the decision is big, it's impossible to show up and have off-the-cuff yet well-thought-out opinions; it just isn't going to happen. 

Have an opinion. Have an opinion even if you know it sucks. View your opinion as something amorphous, open to change, and be ready to accept criticism. This requires you to defend your opinion rather than propose one for the lack of taking a side. 

I've always thought "strong opinions, weakly held" sound right, but the wording never resounded with me.

Defend your opinion until you know it's weakened, then tear it down piece-by-piece. 

This assumes a few things. Firstly, it assumes you are around people who don't personally attack you for having an opinion they think is wrong. Secondly, it requires everyone to have a strong urge to move in the right direction regardless of whose opinion it is. In both of these cases, it's possible, but requires you to be more prepared for your side of the argument.
