title: "The Mythical Man In The Woods"
---

I could build a cabin in a glade in the woods. Inside the house, all essentials would be taken care of: fresh food, few vanities, low ceilings where necessary, and an inglenook fireplace for the Autumn and Winter. Outside, it would have all I need: a garden, a meadow surrounding the house, and trees protecting me from beyond. Visiting would only be done through a path through the woods that opens up onto the meadow leading to my house. Every week a man would drop off a box of essentials like toiletries, tea, and dairy. With Starlink, I would be able to live my life in solitude while playing World of Warcraft.

Shocking? This has been a fantasy every since I was 14. A surprising thing I've come to find is that this is very common:
	"I'd love to move away to the woods."
	"All I need is a house in the hills and WoW."
	"Imagine living in a place like _that_; I'd never leave."
