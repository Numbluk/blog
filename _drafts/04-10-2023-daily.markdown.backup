Around 9:12 PM:

Harold Bloom's *How to Read and Why* arrived tonight. I scanned through the table of contents and it's made me excited to read it further. I'll write about my first impressions tomorrow.

I'm in the middle of Jacob and Esau's story in Genesis and one thing that has really stood out to me so far about the Bible in general is its brutal reality. Jacob and Esau's relationship is like Cain and Able's. Rebekah's favouritism towards Jacob is sad. Reading Esau cry out for a blessing is enough to make a grown man cry:

>*"And Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me—me also, O my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept."*
>
>Genesis 27:38

I realise that Esau married outside of God's chosen people, but at the same time it is a terrible thing to see. Jacob comes off as a real prick. I've only gotten as far as Jacob's ladder, so maybe my mind will soon change.

To reiterate: I still believe the stories are *beyond* epic and they could be novels in and of themselves. I think retelling the story in a modern setting could be fascinating, and possibly a good exercise for next year.

I cooked dinner with Frances today. She was so helpful with chopping vegetables and getting things out and counting everything. I told Caroline that I would be happy if my life was like this everyday. A large part of me could easily buy a home on some land far away from the world and focus only on enjoying the things in front of me. I'm on my phone way too much and it's got to a point of addiction; that ever-creeping sensation of scrolling "just because" rather than "just being" with my kids. I'm going to start putting my phone away during the day in order to take advantage of the time that's here now.

On the topic of next year's curriculum, tomorrow I'm going to begin putting a document together of what I want to accomplish. I'll use this document as a starting point to decide on the details. Also, the sooner this is ready the sooner I will start w

I know I hinted at the excitement in today's journal, but I do want to admit that I'm more than looking forward to reading Shakespeare. The last time I read a Shakespearean play was in the twelfth grade when we read Hamlet. I'm considering getting an audiobook of sorts with background music to try and get a "real" experience. When I read Romeo and Juliet in the ninth or tenth grade, I remember being sucked into the medieval-esque sound effects of the play due to it being read along with audio.
