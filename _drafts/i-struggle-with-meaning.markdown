I Struggle With Meaning

I was raised with a Puritanical work ethic: always try your hardest, no matter the task. Little did I know that doing this for 40 years until I retire and wither away is much harder than it sounds.

It doesn't matter where you sit in the hierarchy, the pain is still there. 

Imagine you are VP of a mid-sized tech company. Directors report to you, you constantly deal with budgeting, politicking to demonstrate your value, but is this it? Is the puzzle of humans really all there is to life? Is the whole point to climb the food chain to make more money, to give to your kids or buy a bigger house?

The highlight of my day is hearing the two little voices of my little girls as they wake up and talk to each other: one whose words are just forming and the other who is learning to craft longer sentences and create dialogue. It's distilled beauty and innocence. I also look forward to picking them up from nursery and seeing them run to me to give me a hug and see them run wild after a day of busyness. What is the value of work in the face of this? In fact, what is the point of work after reaching a level of monetary comfort?

Comfort is a dangerous place. I don't do well here. Without a push, I flounder and become aimless and demotivated. It is when I do my worst work. The alpine climb keeps my eyes on the prize, but I cease to exist on the plain. When the prize becomes questionable, I begin to question the purpose of the climb: why put one foot in front of the other, why struggle for more money if it's all pointless anyway?

This is the great question of meaning. What's my purpose? Where is my Ring to destroy? Where is my band of merry fellows? Where is the adventure? Is adventure the key to it all? What happens if work doesn't give me adventure? Should I assume that there's a risk it never will? If so, what do I do to create adventure?
