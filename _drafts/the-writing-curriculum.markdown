# The Writing Curriculum

The goal of this curriculum is to spend an entire year dramatically improving my abilities as a writer to eventually become an author. I have things to say.

## The Approach

This curriculum will take the form of the SMART acronym:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Realistic
- Time-bound

Each section in this curriculum will strictly adhere to this format by requiring every facet of detail to be under a SMART category.

## Specific

Objective clearly states, so anyone reading it can understand, what will be done 
and who will do it.

I will read and evaluate objectively good authors with the purpose being to better understand the following facets of storytelling: plot, characters, setting, conflict, theme, point of view, tone, language, and style.

For each story that I read, I will fill out the storytelling elements.

I will aim for a two-to-one ratio of reading and writing with the focus to be on improving writing based on what I'm learning.

I will practise writing. 

- What kind of writing?
- How will I know I'm getting better? Should I try and write a short story before I start the year?

## Measurable

Objective includes how the action will be measured.  Measuring your 
objectives helps you determine if you are making progress.  It keeps you on track and on 
schedule. 

I will focus on four mediums:

- Novels: The Canterbury Tales, Moby Dick, Waverly, Great Expectations, Blood Meridian, Usula Leguin, The Castle of Otranto (?), The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Monk by Matthew Lewis, Dracula by Bram Stoker
- Short stories: Anton Chehkov, Pushkin, Nabokov, Flannery O'Connor, The Great God Pan and Other Horror Stories
- Plays: Shakespeare, Ben Johnson
- Poetry: Paradise Lost, The Odyssey, The Aeneid, Metamorphoses, Beowulf, The Idylls of the King, The Prose Edda, The Temple - Geroge Herbert
- Philosophy: On the Sublime - Longinus, 

- Which ones?


This Curriculum makes the assumption that it is difficult to openly criticise one's writing as soon as it is written, therefore I will write as much as I can and critique the writing at a steady pace in the future. For now, I will aim to write 

- 5 "short" novels with 70,000 words each within the year
- This is the equivalent of around 1,00 words per day every day of the year

After each novel is done, I will put it away in a box to be critiqued at a later date.

## Attainable

Objective is realistic given the realities faced in the community.  Setting 
reasonable objectives helps set the project up for success.

The primary risk here is that it I am not overly familiar with how long it will take to go through a given work.  

## Relevant

A relevant objective makes sense, that is, it fits the purpose of the grant, it fits the 
culture and structure of the community, and it addresses the vision of the project. 

This curriculum makes the assumption that 	reading twice as much as I write, and trying to understand what good writing is, will pay off more than a more equal ratio or one which is weighted heavier towards writing.

## Time-bound

The bound for time will be exactly one year. The official start date will be January 1st, 2024 and end on December 31st, 2024. These dates may backward or forward to make the time commitment more realistic during the Christmas season, however, the length of time will remain.
