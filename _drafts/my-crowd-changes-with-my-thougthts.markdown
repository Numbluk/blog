title: "I Don't Care About SEO"
---

This blog is far from being optimised for SEO. On the other hand, I could be lying. I don't really know what it would mean even if I accidentally optimised for a Google bot. I can tell you this: if I'm optimising for SEO then I'm optimising for the wrong audience.

Everyday, I write down titles for topics I'd like to write about in my drafts folder. Taking a quick look at them now, I see the following:

1. Blogging Arc's
2. My Right Mind
3. Manager's Manager

At the moment, the audience might look like this:

1. Bloggers
2. Philosphers/General Readers
3. Tech

Let's say I oriented myself towards being a growth blogger. My audience becomes:

1. SEO
2. SEO
3. SEO

I just did a Google search for "how to store carrots". This is likely not an uncommon question. In fact, it's so common that many familiar websites have *entire blog posts* on how to store carrots. Here are the top five domains:

1. Allrecipes
2. Food52
3. GardenersWorld
4. MasterClass
5. SouthernLiving

What is unique amongst all of them? They don't tell me within *100* words. Let's use Food52 as an example. Their blog post consists of an introduction paragraph and a ludicrously long paragraph entitled, "What's A Carrot, Anyway?" (thanks, that's exactly what I searched for) before the finally enlighten me with "Whatâ€™s the Best Way to Store Carrots?" which is actually detailed and useful. That's **436 words** before they even begin to tell me how to store a carrot! This doesn't even include the cookies popup, the oversized photo of carrots, 15 chilis, a just cracked bulb of garlic, and a chef's knife, not just one, but two rows of photos linking to their store, and to top it all off a recipe audio playlist with hot hits such as the 45 minute long "Maurizio Leo makes Her Butter Rolls". Exhausting? Imagine reading through it. The absurdity of this is why it's the title of this blog post. 

The sad part of this is that SEO limits genuinely good content from ranking higher in Google. I imagine someone has created an HTML-only website on food storage which tells me exactly what I want and doesn't assault my brain with images.

This blog is for me and each blog post is for a specific audience. It's the defining aspect of my blog. 

- Each post is catered to a specific audience, even if it's "general", but never SEO
- I want to be critiqued. It's the only way I'll get better. This means natural growth is the only thing to get me there.
- My product is my words
- I choose an audience to have an opinion. If your target is a search engine, then you'll sound like every other blog I encounter. Why should I bother? In the current world, quality sticks out like a sore thumb.
