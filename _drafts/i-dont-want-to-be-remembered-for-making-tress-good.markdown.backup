My biggest fear is looking back on my life and not creating something which matters. This is obviously a greater discussion of what matters and how it differs from person to person.

Out of every comment I've ever read on HackerNews, I remember this one the most. It's funny how it's a quote of a quote of an unnamed author. Legends exist even in modern times. I'm sure time will go by and people say, "marvin never existed" and they'll use this article as research, but in the end it won't be proof enough for X, Y, and Z.

## Move the following to a different blog post entitled "CRUD apps are hard"

I've often been afraid of not persisting after death. Not in relation to Heaven, but here on Earth. Many will say this is a prideful goal or a pointless one. When I dig deeper, I come to the conclusion that it's not persistence for the sake of it, but being remembered for something I did which meaningfully improved the lives of others. I care deeply about this. In fact, I had a draft blog post sitting idle for almost two years about "not wanting to write cruds apps for the rest of my life". Some might see the irony in me becoming a manager as many managers are famous for burning value over creating it on the path to the top. 

I will say that my perspective since becoming a manager has changed tremendously. Like some other managers, I miss the day-to-day technical work (if I could have it in my own way, that is). The core of what has changed has more to do with the fact that CRUD apps are hard. Doing something well is hard. Design matters a tremendous amount and this is what I've grown to care about the most. As long as I'm striving towards a goal, then that's what truly matters. At the very least, that's where I find meaning. There is beauty in well-crafted code, but the end-result gives it that transcendent experience.
