# October 20th

I'm in my office on Crouch Road,
Listening to nothing,
And it's around 11:15 PM:

I almost got up at 6:20 AM today, but ended up going back to sleep. Some part of me must have said that I would regret it, and sure enough the girls were up at 7:00 AM again. I don't understand why because Frances is incredibly tired when she comes home from nursery; you would think she'd want to sleep in!

Anyway, this slingshot sleep schedule has me incredibly tired right now. I played Planescape: Torment for the first time in a while. In fact, it's the first time I've played any game in a while.

I've been thinking about sailing. When I first did it this year I loved it. It's an extreme sport, at least mentally. There are some good times and some very bad times. I think it's the incredible ups and downs which have me leaning away from it as a hobby.

On the topic of hobbies: when it comes to writing, I feel far away from what I want to aim for. All I see is a long, drawn out road with no real payout. Better grammar is the baby step of baby steps and I'm years away from any tangible output for anything else.

Clearly I'm feeling discouraged. 

The unknown is painful for me. No true goal besides "get published". And it's a long road there.

What is most painful is the thought of being forgotten. These thoughts and feelings aren't well-structured, so it might take multiple entries to achieve the true meaning. As a start, I'm worried about being forgotten. "Forgotten by whom?" is a good start. For starters, my family. My wife and my children. Beyond that, my parents, siblings, nephews, and nieces. Next up would be my grandchildren. After them, my great-grandchildren. After that, does it matter? I recall my great-grandparents with fond feelings, but nothing of any depth. 

What about my colleagues? No.
What about my friends? Very, very few. One, really. William.
What about my community? Maybe.
What about the world? Yes.

If I could sum it up, it would be 1.) my blood and 2.) the world. I do
