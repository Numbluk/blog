title: "You're Not Noah"

I'm not ready to write a novel, but I'm ready to write a million words. 

A sure-fire way to drown is to jump in the deep end when you know you can't swim. If you're an aspiring writer, don't write novels. I often see this advice dolled out to eager minds looking to write the best-selling novel they've never seemed to have the inspiration for. Start small. Write blogs. Push a little further and write essays and short stories. Before you know it, you'll know if you can reach the average length of an adult novel: ~80,000 words.

I personally struggle with lofty goals that show no clear progression. As much as I'd like to think I could be heralded forever in the classics section of my local used book store, that is one mountain I am not ready to climb. For starters, writing an average novel is a feat unto itself. At 500 words a day that's *160* days of your life spent writing a rough draft version of something you have no idea whether it is good or not. More importantly, how do you know if you're even getting better in that time? 

Writing is an ever-changing process, so many would argue that skill progress when writing a novel could be tracked in some way. Write. Edit. Rinse and repeat. This is all good and fine, but how do you actually track progress to any real extent when your story is over 300 pages? How can you tell that one page isn't worth the paper it's written on compared with five versions later where the story might have changed tremendously since? 

Writing is hard, so I won't make the learning path harder on myself. I'm starting with blogs for a reason: they are almost entirely self-contained from any post I write before or after. Revisions I make can far more easily be compared without needing to think about the context of a page sitting within three hundred other pages and versions.

The beauty of self-contained blogs gives me just enough difficulty to push me to form a coherent story, but not enough to become overwhelmed with 50 side character's backstories and their political roles.

Above all, short-form writing allows me to experiment with language which is the entire point. I can play with words and sentence structure. I can easily get feedback from an audience and test ways of editing. On the same page, I can see if I'm making a straight line from A to B. If we talk about writing having an ending, as opposed to "art never ending", then I wouldn't be able to capture the entire process so quickly if I was writing a novel.

This is the whole point of one million words: writing to learn. 

On the contrary, writing a novel is perhaps easier. One sentence doesn't carry as much weight in a sea of words, so the pressure to be precise is drastically reduced, however, I have that lofty goal where each sentence carries the same weight no matter the output (essay, article, etc.). 
 
Maybe you can't relate, maybe you're different, maybe you're inspired by Providence and no matter what anyone says you're still going to build that Ark. There are no hard and fast rules to writing that I'm aware of, but I can see clear parallels to other crafts. Recommending an aspiring writer to start off by "just writing a book" is like telling an aspiring home cook to prepare *haute cuisine* as a way to get better at cooking. Sure you may get there, but, well, can you? After all, you're not really Noah.
