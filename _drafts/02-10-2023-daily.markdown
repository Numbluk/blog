Around 9:33 PM:

I'm tired. Rosalind has been sick and home all day and she refused to take a nap; luckily her spirits have been good and she's been without a fever. Not so fortunately, Frances threw up twice tonight and will be off from nursery for the next few days. I'd didn't get much work done today.  I wonder what other parents do when their children get sick; do they take sick days? It's funny how the world pays for its inefficienciesâ€”if only Caroline didn't have to work.

I've been thinking a lot about the idea of spending my 123 days on writing. In fact, I'm almost committed, however, I need to come up with a curriculum. So far, I'm considering the following topics: grammar, literary criticism, Western Greats, style focus, vocabulary, and modern fiction classics. The main focus is to become a good writer, so I still need to decide on what is SMART.

Specific: Become a good writer by having a work accepted by a literary publication.
Measurable: I can only measure output, but the obvious fault here is that it doesn't measure whether or not it's "good". The obvious response to this is to accept what is 
Achievable: It depends on what is to be measured. I want to push myself hard, but I don't want to give up if I don't accomplish it.
Relevant: I need to make sure that the work I do aligns with accomplishing something that I'm interested in, even if it's career related.
Time-Bound/Trackable: Again, it depends. I need to come up with a curriculum. 

Because I'd commit to this in 2024, I need to prepare a curriculum, study plan, and set of expectations for each month before then. Ideally I'd also finish the grammar side of things before 2024 along with introduction books (such as Bloom's "How to Read and Why").

This journal is somewhat short today because I've been researching various books of Bloom's. Also, with only limited time, I want to make sure my focus is on the right things: namely trying to achieve the goal of this journey.
