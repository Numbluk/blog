Culture, Remote Work, and World of Warcraft

I grew up playing World of Warcraft so much that, like many teenagers who played it, my parents had to curb my computer time because I would have spent every night after school playing it instead of focusing on school. 

I've made some good friends in World of Warcraft. I'd talk to some friends almost every single day; I knew that they had kids, what they did for a living, and how they reacted in stressful situations. The curious thing about my online friends is that I never met them in person, in fact, I never even saw some of their faces. We talked loads of shit about why the Horde sucks, why Paladins were imbalanced for PvP, and my plans for raiding on Friday night, but if I wouldn't even recognise them if I passed them in the street. 

My friends and guildmates allowed me to form strong bonds of camaraderie, but how is this possible without ever having seen their face? Surely the back-to-office advocates would say that this is impossible, that my feelings were a confused sense of idleness mixed with an unreal world. 

I never wanted a 9-to-5. I dropped out of college to avoid it. I ran headlong into a place of high risk, but high reward. It's funny how a lack of camaraderie kills the soul and meaning of work. There is no us vs. them, there is no chorus of expletive-driven complaining--it's just the clock and your output, the morning stand-up and the quiet goodbye.

Everyone may not be my friend or friends with each other, but we're in it together. We share goals, we share work.

I appreciate a high quality of life. 

What made my online friends so special? We had different, but similar objectives: get gear, be as good as we could be, fight the enemy (or not), and as many variations as the game could offer. On the other hand, every single objective could be flipped. Some didn't play for gear, some didn't want to be the best, but we still got on. We still chatted until 3 A.M. about the upcoming patch and how it was going to ruin the game. 

What about my colleagues in the remote world? It's so similar it's uncanny:


I look back in sadness with the fact that I will never talk with some of them again. Some of them might have passed away and I will never know.
