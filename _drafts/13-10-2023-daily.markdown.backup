# October 13th

I'm in Caroline's old room on Esmond Road,
Listening to hum of the city coming from the window,
And it's around 12:36 AM:

This is a late entry, so it will be short. I'll have two entries for today.

We came into London tonight in a record of about one hour and fifty minutes. Sally offered me some wine which hit my gag reflex like I was 18 again; it was less than smooth. And the girls went down somewhat easily, except for Frances who woke up a couple of times because she was likely too hot or too scared of the dark.

Deliveroo officially announced its return to office policy. I'll find out today what this means for me. I think I'll have three options: move teams, move back to being an IC after promotion, or leave the company. Unfortunately, I've got a baby on the way, so the last options is not the best.

I want to leave tech. Or at least tech as its publicly known. I'm unsure as to what I'll choose in the end, but at the very least I can at least publicly admit it to myself.
