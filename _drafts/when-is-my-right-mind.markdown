When is my right mind? 

- When I'm tired, everything is sad.
- Compare this to drinking. What if you asked a man if he'd throw away his marriage for a moment's pleasure? What about throwing his life away for the faintest slight of aggression? A single blow from the coward's fist propelled by London Pride sending the father of four to his death. 
- What about broken-hearted man sending childlike love poems in vain to his ex-wife?
- What about when you're at the top of the mountain?
- What about the man who just received a much-earned raise after breaking his back to get there?

So when is it? Is it the average of our extremes? I'll assign a weighted proportion for a sad and happy event and take the average of the two. Or maybe all decisions should be made when we're at our lowest, so that we're always most critical. Or maybe all decisions should be made when we're at our highest, so that we're always most ambitious.

Every morning I walk to a 500 year-old cobbled quayside.
