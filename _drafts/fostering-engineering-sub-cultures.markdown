Fostering engineering culture is hard. In the early days, your immediate reach is the entire company, so it's easy to move things at pace because not only can you talk to anyone easily, but everyone knows you and cares about you so they are willing to go along for the ride to see what you have to say.

As time moves on and the company grows, a push may fall on deaf ears. 

Bottom-up culture is almost always driven by a few key individuals. It's not that these engineers are geniuses wanting to impart their knowledge on a less-knowing world, it's more often that their personal interest align with work in a very specific way. A few examples would be: public speaking, a programming language, documentation (yes, there are even people passionate about better documentation).

These engineers have a few qualities to make it possible. They have good communication skills. They are passionate about what they're trying to grow. They take the chance that many people might not actually care too much about what they have to say. However, above and beyond all of this is that they push and constantly push. They lead the interactions, they grow the community, they ensure meetings are well-planned, they act as the point of contact for any questions. It's draining, and because it's draining you need someone willing to have a key set of traits to make things happen. Also, because it's hard, you likely won't see huge contributions of "sub-cultures" making into impact statements at review time (hint: for managers afraid to bake this into your leveling standards, take note).

An organisation obviously needs a sharing and open culture for this to happen in the first place. Consider this the pre-requisite for bottom-up culture. The top-down culture is primarily driven by managers and forms the red lines the community can't cross and sets the standard for boundaries. For instance, if your if your company is hostile to new ideas and doesn't have a forum for sharing across a hierarchy then it will unlikely bottom-up culture will be fostered. 

The company also needs to drive this from the bottom rungs: boots-on-the-ground managers should actively encourage participation and try and identify and advocate for this.

Hiring is an interesting one. I'm not a fan of knowing what people do in their free time. Many companies love to see engineers who do "work on side projects outside of work". This is nonsense. I've never seen a strong correlation between those who program on the side and engineers who build a culture of learning around programming at a company. In fact, I find that this fosters only one aspect of work and one which many engineers should already be meeting the bar for when hired. Let's look at it this way, if you only hire for engineering side projects then you will likely neglect the benefits you may receive from hiring engineers with better soft skills. Imagine a highly technical culture where many engineers struggle or lack an ability to communicate well: missed requirements, lack of collaboration, and a struggle to make big decisions when it's needed. It's chaos. 

One thing you will see is that these sub-cultures determine the future of your company in many ways you may not expect. Sub-cultures motivate and push creativity. It allows people to work at the fringe of work: the boundary where work and personal interests touch. But more than this, passion begets passion (link to other post) so you get more people involved and trained and the communities grow.
