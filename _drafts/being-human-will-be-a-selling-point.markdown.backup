title: "'Made By Humans' Will Soon Be A Selling Point"

- Introduction: Relate beef changes to align with what's "pure" or aligns to our more pastoral state. In individual conversations, I always see this "it's not organic", "what's it made from?", and even "was this made local?"
	+ Fight for authenticity
- Imagine a scenario where you read a book which is the most profound book you read. This book turned your life inside out and you stared outside the window every day for the next ten days pondering its impact. Now let's assume you discover that this very same book was written by a computer where the author simply said: "Write me a sad story about a boy who loses his father at an early age, overcomes all odds to find his father's killed and at the last moment decides to spare him when he realizes this evil man did it to protect the protagonist." A couple hours later, the machine spits out a 325 page novel and becomes an overnight bestseller. How do you feel? Wronged? Lied to? 
	+ Two camps:
	+ It doesn't matter when you can't distinguish between what's a computer and what's not.
	+ Appalled and horrified that you became invested in something not explicitly written by a human.
- This is a modern tale with a twist. It goes back to how content is measured and criticised and specifically between two schools of thought: reader-response and New Criticism.
- New Criticism wages the argument that the only thing which mattered was the content.
- Reader-response wages that the author is what matters.
- I don't run in many modern English circles, and judging by the bestsellers at the nationwide bookshops I'm not sure I'd want to, but I don't think New Criticism is all that popular anymore.
- The inflection point is when you cannot tell a difference. How do we know the author did what they told us? Line by line, word by word. Does trust matter? If you tie in with the reader-response formula then it is all that matters. You break the trust, and you get reactions of disgust, abhorrence, and people up in arms about tearing down computers and data centers.
- Personally, I care about the human behind the glass. I'm willing to shed more of my pay-check to fund humans to create and express themselves and to not lose what it means to be human. 
- There is no free lunch. Modern advocates of AI remind me of Monsanto's arguments for genetically modified crops. Are you against progress? You're just a Luddite who can't get with the times. I for one, welcome things smarter and more powerful than I. Think of how many lives can be saved with this technology!
	+ What are the costs? What have the marvels of tech brought us today? All I hear are the "think of the medical field and the children we saved" while there are more slaves in the world today than at any time in history. All I read is "buy now, pay later" while people struggle to put food on their tables. All I see is "Real People, Real Videos" while people filter themselves out of existence, entire swathes of the population struggle with depression, and the soul of the world is dying. 
- And who will stop it? There is no saviour. The battle will be between a few faceless leviathans who compete for dominance while the world watches and does nothing.

In my lifetime, I've seen beef take the following shapes: US Grade Beef, Organic Beef, Grass-Fed Beef. It's hard not to think about this as a fight for authenticity. Just look at the US farming industry's complaints about beef wannabes like Beyond Meat and Impossible Burgers: they are neither meat nor burgers and they're advertising is misleading. 

Just wait until you can't tell the difference.

If it were up to me, the entire tech industry could fall off a cliff. After all the promises, we are now fatter, more depressed, and most are poorer after all this time. I say this as I host this blog through the company very much responsible for AI spelling our doom: Microsoft.
