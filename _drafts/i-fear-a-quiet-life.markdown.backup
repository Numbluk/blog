In the last six years the following happened: I moved to England, got engaged and married, had two children, went through two lay-offs, moved six times, and was promoted three times. I wonder about the next six years. I'll probably have more children, I'll probably move again, and the stress of further promotions will only increase. 

When does it end? I ask that question too, although I'm not certain I'd want it. There's never a good excuse to not do the things I want to do; there's always time. Even with a working wife, several kids, and a career. There always is. 

What is the point of a quiet life? One imagines the peacefulness of a monk in the medieval fortress spending their day away in contemplation when in reality the workshop of their dedication to transcribing, translating, and philosophising rings as loud as the blacksmith in the town.

So what is a quiet life? It means two different things: withering your life away without industry or purpose and the other is having the time to dedicate to the things you love in a place of solitude. 

For many, retiring is a goal. And then they die.


Let me introduce you to the scariest place I've ever visited: the American nursing home. When I was younger, I would visit my mother, a nurse, as she was signing off for the day or was on lunch break. Even though she stopped working at nursing homes when I was 7, the feelings of being inside have stuck with me to this day--the smell of decay is not forgotten easily. Nursing homes are the loneliest place on earth. My mom is the most caring person I've met, so many of her patients truly appreciated having her around. They also probably enjoyed a young person such as myself waltzing in and trying to do my best to understand their slow manner and sometimes stroke-ridden speech. We talk of children dependent on the system, but let me paint a horror: you have twenty years of life left, you have a condition which means you can't quite get around so easily and need to be supported on a daily basis, and you nor your children can't afford to send you to a nice care home so they send you to one which relies completely on your Government benefits. These people are completely and utterly dependent on the system and they are on the bitter end of life.

These are people who will not get better with age. They will stay in the nursing home, make some friends who will disappear as they fade with age, and watch rerun after rerun of Wheel of Fortune and the Price is Right. Their family will visit them from time to time, probably more in the beginning, but less so as time goes on. 

Who cares about these people? The general populace loves to slam "old people" when in reality they love slamming older, well-off people. The truth is, no one and likely no one ever will give a shit about these people. They have no voice, they are trapped inside a prison and are doomed to die there because they cannot afford anything better. 

This is one of the rare instances where I would rather die early than be condemned. The smell, the lack of funding, the evolution from walkers to wheelchairs to bedridden. 

This feeling and smell has had a profound impact on me from a young age. In my adult life it's led me to save and save and save and care deeply about the choices I make for my family. The occasional visits from churches or local schoolchildren must be a dream for them. Imagine: a group of young children, drinking in life with paint and pencils and constant chattering sitting next to wheelchair bound prisoners, with no care at all in the world or how the world has led the person sitting next to them to be there. Together they craft a symphony of innocent paintings which are hung up in the sitting room next to the wall with the TVs playing X and Y each signed with their names: Suzie - 7, Mable - 83 and then, just as it came, it's gone. Back to the cell. Back to the nightly check-in by the nurse before being helped into bed to watch more of the 1990s TV sitting next to the two photos of the only son who rarely visits before falling asleep. Mable will die in 7 years; that's 2,555 days more of TV and loneliness.
