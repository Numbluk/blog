Around 4:34 PM:

I had a dream last night where my dad sat in his normal manner with his leg crossed listening to me relay my current life's concerns (first through a message which I had sent earlier on his phone and then at that point in person). He put his hand in a fist with his elbow on the chair and cocked his head as he does and said, "It sounds like we should talk". I'm not normally one to act off a dream, in fact I don't think I ever have, but I do feel compelled to do so today. Interestingly enough, I hadn't responded to my dad's Whatsapp messages in about a week and I find his potential idea to provide a credit card to people with high credit scores a little more than interesting.

Regarding Worknotes (mentioned for the first time in yesterday's diary), I was able to get a basic Rails up and running with both Tailwind and Webpacker today. Regenerating the project from scratch did the trick :) I'm going to spend some time tonight thinking about the design, so that I can get to work on it. I was having a chat with Steve Leach (TPM) today and he mentioned that he really struggled with the constant context switching--I do wonder if I'm really onto something here.

I'm beginning to "feel" at the next level as a manager (L6). It seems like the easiest way to get there is by caring. I do sometimes wonder though if giving up on being an IC was the right choice. A very strong part of me believes that the corporate world where I'm not the benevolent dictator is not the right place for me. I find little value in forcing meaning into my day-to-day because I have no skin in the game.

Around 11:07 PM:

I didn't get to chat with Dad tonight as he happened to phone in the midst of the Fun Fair revelry. One of my favourite things to see is Frances or Rosalind so happy that they uncontrollably move or squeal--such things remind me how lucky I am to have such beautiful little Girls. I plan to chat with Dad tomorrow; he was also unavailable for the rest of the night due to work in Chicago.

I decided I'll print my journals off on a monthly basis, almost as a periodical. God forbid should anyone be bored enough to read this! I should brush up on my writing.

The above plan led me to a new idea: a specialised service which caters to printing off journals... never mind! it looks as though there is a service which does this already. I'll try it out. I don't mind hand-writing, but I struggle to get all my thoughts to paper without it consuming a lot more time (not that that's a bad thing!). Another part of it is carpal tunnel which has really been getting to me lately.

On the topic of health, I really do need to see a doctor. I've put off several things for far too long (why do humans do this?). Primarily, I need to see someone about my carpal tunnel, right hip pain, and tooth fillings. What a laundry list... I'
