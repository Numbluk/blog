title: "AI Is The New Crypto"
---

We have now entered a new wave of hype: AI. Prepare

Introduction: "I didn't believe in crypto, but AI is the real thing." Sound familiar? We've just lived through a condensed time period where Crypto has ridden several waves of adoption and promised so much, but yielded so little. Tech clearly has the memory of a goldfish. It's so obvious that I almost feel like it shouldn't be said, but then I read daily posts about how an AI-backed document editor is going to be the next billion-dollar unicorn. It's as if the symbols are human in nature and therefore impossible to avoid: the hero, the news, and the oh so very terrible companies we will see collapse.
Point 1: Our hero. The nerd, just a new type. One a little more refined. He comes off soft-spoken and highly spoken of. The headlines. Forbes, FT, their face is plastered.  All the interviews say he's smart, hides his feelings, has a strong vision.
Point 2: The waves of news. New tools. The hype machine. Companies sponsoring useless AI divisions because, hey, why not? 
Point 3: A wave of terrible companies. Where will we be in five years? What products will exist? money flowing like a river to grease the wheels of Nividia's GPU cards and AWS' data centers. Most of the tools are useless.
Conclusions: Some people will likely make money. Some people will lose a lot of money. The S-curve is a real thing. If you haven't seen it before, it looks something like this. Where are we?
