# October 14th

I'm in Caroline's old room on Esmond Road,
Listening to sound of Hubba Bubba losing its flavour within 60 seconds,
And it's around 11:10 AM:

I ended up not having two entries for yesterday. I drank three-and-a-half pints and came home, fell asleep just after 11:00 PM, and woke up at nearly 9:00 AM. This week's exhaustion has gotten the better of me (and the alcohol).

We had met up with Belen and her friend Shona at the Churchill Pub in Notting Hill. The pub itself was lovely: flours adorning outer walls, a variety of pots and pewter mugs covering the ceiling, and an amicable, if touristy crowd. We caught up with Belen and Shona again today, but we took the girls for a tiring hour-long journey to Borough Market. I knew it'd be a bad idea, but I didn't speak up. Funny enough, Belen really didn't want do deal with the crowds either as she was feeling quite sick and had a fever the night before. Belen's father, Fabian, and a friend she hadn't seen since high school, Zonya(?), were there as well. We capped off the meeting with Pret, so that we could have some breathing room to catch up. I just want to make a not that I really do like Fabian, he is a very interested individual and is very easy to get along with; it almost makes me sad that I don't get to see them for long stretches of time.

Who knows what will happen before the next time we see each other. Life is dense, and it seems as though Belen will be wanting to leave Peru by December. My bets are on her going back to stay with her parents in Texas until she finds a job in Mexico.

When Caroline, the Girls, and I got back to Esmond road, Caroline and I went to the High Road. We visited a charity book shop which had a great selection of high quality hardback books, of which I purchased Dylan Thomas' "Under Milk Wood". We then went to Waterstones, which I almost always find disappointing, before heading to Foster Books: a book shop with hard backs that could last hundreds of years. Something about seeing the books in Foster's makes me not want to go into mainstream bookshops because I don't want to support a low quality culture of books that will only last ten years. It also got me thinking about purchasing rare books in general. The child inside me starts climbing the castle and readying my sword and armour when I think of a personal library, and especially with one which holds books which are not only rare, but have a note of personal rarity to them. In other words, I'm considering buying first-editions or autographed editions of certain books like "The Hobbit" or "Chronicles of Narnia". Books are the ultimate expression of art and to become responsible for special editions of these books elevates me to a childhood level of guardian and caretaker of some of the most important works ever written.

The boat came up in conversation today with Fabian. I'm still unsure how to feel about it and I'm still leaning towards getting rid of it, especially with the uncertainty of my job and this economy. I hope the next UK election will bring back politics as usual (in the best way possible) because some stability in my life would really help with the voluntary instability in other parts (the Curriculum).

I've been thinking about what I want as "a feeling" in my life in terms of visualisation. I've said this before, but I'm a strong believer in one's ability to "will" certain aspects of their life into existence. Anyway, I'll have more to say on this tomorrow because nothing is set in stone and putting my thoughts to paper should help me make a cohesive story anyway. I will say that having Caroline share a very similar vision of the future has helped tremendously when it comes to this visualisation; who knew that all those sermons as a child on .
