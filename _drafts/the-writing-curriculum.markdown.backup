# The Writing Curriculum

The goal of this curriculum is to spend an entire year dramatically improving my abilities as a writer to eventually become an author. I have things to say.

## The Approach

This curriculum will take the form of the SMART acronym:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Realistic
- Time-bound

Each section in this curriculum will strictly adhere to this format by requiring every facet of detail to be under a SMART category.
