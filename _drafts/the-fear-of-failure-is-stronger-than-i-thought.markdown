# Getting Over My Crippling Fear of Failure

- Intro: Describe the feeling
	+ Typical software engineer who would love to do something on the side, but has always avoided the effort
	+ Committing to the unknown is hard.
	+ Like most who want to make a dent in the world, I will often latch onto ideas
	+ I spend a lot of time diving into an idea, weeks even. Obsessing over ideas, drawing sketches, exploring forums and discovering potential features, and even putting my friends through the hell of unfinished thoughts. 
	+ Fear is often masked as logic. And maybe it is. It is natural to be protective of change.
	+ Building castles in the air is fun; who has time to really build them(??)? I've got a family, I've got work, I've got __priorities_. Unfortunately, this doesn't add up. You see, I was a master architect even when I didn't have such a busy life. Like most who want to make a dent in the world, I will often latch onto ideas as they come. I know all the tricks about harvesting ideas: keep pen and paper at the ready, fire the idea through an email, strike while the iron's hot(??)! With the idea bubbling underneath the surface, I dive in. Over the days and weeks the idea is at the forefront of my mind: sketches are drawn, forums are explored, and potential features are logged for when I hit it big. Brick by brick, the idea is built.
- But then it stops just as quickly as it came and in the same way: an idea, a question. ""I'm not so certain this will work after all", "Is it really worth the time?", "I don't think anyone will find it useful". The fear of failure is hard to understand because it's not obvious
- My oh-so favourite one is "What else could I be doing?" As if I dedicated anytime to my personal life in the first place. A constant stream of ideas and lust for change is a deadly combination if it's not controlled. You will find yourself 60 years old wishing you had "written that book" or "pursued that business".
	+ If only I could do X
	+ It isn't worth wasting the time
	+ What if no one cares about what I do?
	+ It's funny because I've made some extreme decisions which impacted years of my life, and yet I can't even dedicate a month or two to an idea?
- Curiosity
- Discipline
- The eternal pull between tackling something that might fail and pursuing "passions" is still there, but the funny thing is that I also neglected those too. 
- It's still hard. Is AI going to kill everything I do? What about the other things I could do like play video games or read books? I heavily consider this in my mind and it's funny because these are the things I tend to neglect. 
- Part of the learning process has been understanding that startup strategies are also ways to mitigate this fear and avoid regret: start small, do something local, work in public, open yourself to criticism as soon as possible.
- All is not lost, I'm doing something now. Maybe this is taking the leap of faith and why it's described so such:
	+ "a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die."
	+ and maybe that's why he said his advice of courage is not mysticism, but everyday advice
