I'm not perfect--I've done things. I don't want to be accepted for who I am as an individual. I want someone to tell me to shut the fuck up and push through it, to slap me on the ass and tell me to keeping going.

I'm a liar, a cheat, and a thief. I've yelled, cursed, hit, and punched. I'm a brute. I have nasty thoughts. By all accounts I'm a human being. The bar is low and I struggle to reach it. Why would I ever want to be accepted as this, thing? God help those who think they are okay the way they are. I've seen some of these people. Imagine fighting and belittling other people to accept the lowly piece of shit we know you truly are, the way everyone is (we're all in this together after all). Imagine fighting to be accepted as okay. Are we okay as we are? I don't think so. 

The mediocrity and hidden thoughts of our age give us a false sense of being. 

There are those who complain about too much work, but all they do is consume media. If only we could all have this life of leisure! If only it we could all set sail towards the horizon of being freed from the bonds of corporations and landlords, the evil.

Do I accept being evil as that is who I am? If there is no evil then why go on? What is the point of helping other forms of cohesive structures of atoms and molecules live a better life because it makes the atoms and molecules in their brain act a certain way which we define as "feeling good"? Why should I do things for myself it is the same situation? There is nothing. There are no philosophies to fill the void. The pain of life does not justify going on.

But what about the alternative? What if there is meaning? What if the meaning is the key to it all? What am I doing now? Why don't I reach out and grasp it with both hands and never let go? What is out there just beyond the city and town and village hiding in plain sight? There must be a man out there who can tell me the meaning of it all.

If only I knew the meaning. It would be the flashpoint miracle of life.
