I'm married. I have two beautiful little girls, ages two and three. I have a home. I have a boat. I live in a beautiful place.

I have a lot to lose.

How do you balance the quest for adventure with the beauty of everyday life? I don't want to miss out on the lives of my children. I want to see them grow up, get married, have children or even grandchildren. God, I love them so much. Am I the only one who thinks this way?

There was a point in my life where dying didn't scare me. I had faith that something was on the other side. That the temporal effects of anything were insignificant with the Other. But then I met Frances. Imagine meeting a soul so close to your own it was like a piece of you had been ripped out and moulded into the most perfect girl. And if you could see her eyes! Her blue orbs mirror the sunny rays bouncing off the North Sea. Her pure blonde hair catching rays of sunlight where there is none. A laugh so infectious that it attracts any passer-by.

And then I met Rosalind.
