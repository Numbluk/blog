Rice & Cole Boatyard, Burnham-on-Crouch - Chatham Maritime Marina, Chatham

The trip started well enough, we were off the pontoon a half hour after 09:00, it was partly cloudy, and everything was pushing us except the wind. Phil asked us some critical questions which I either struggled to have answers to or had an even worse answer, "no": "have you tested the depth of the depthometer?", "did you bring along a jerry-can of fuel?", "I'm off to use the loo, I hope it works".

It wasn't long before we realised the sea-cock for the head was completely locked in the off position. For the rest of the trip we had to get inventive (or desperate) through a cup, sink, or other such means of transport. Sailing is not made for pessimists. 

Once we neared the edge of the sand flats, we sailed most of the day. By the time we arrived in Chatham at 17:30, we headed off into the shopping area located closely to the marina. The networking for the marina door was currently under test, so we had to find someone to let us in. It's nice to be in a marina where civilisation is nearby and we can find tools, KFC, and bubble tea.

Sadly the tools didn't relieve our toilet situation which meant Midnight Lady had to come out of the water to be fixed as soon as we got home, or as soon as us men wanted to avoid aiming into a sink heeled over at 20 degrees or you women needing to be even more inventive at the same angle.

The first night of a sailing trip is typically the roughest. You've had a long day--when you're sailing when is it not?--but you're not so tired that you can sleep through the awkward bedding.

There is something special about St. Kat's. 

Maybe it's because even at Â£80 a night, which means it's likely to be one of the most expensive marinas in the country, it's still the cheapest night you'll ever have in Central London. 

Maybe it's because it's the most central you'll get with a yacht unless you can somehow manage to pry open Tower Bridge and take down your mast(s) as you head further into the Thames (the life of a Thames Barge is glamorous).

But is sure isn't the trip there.

Remember, the roughest night is the first which very well means The second day of a sailing trip is typically the roughest. You didn't sleep the night before and you will likely wake up much earlier than the day you set off as a result and you will likely leave early with the tide, which is always an hour earlier than you'd like to be ready for.

Out and down the lock, we are steady on the Medway. We very nearly run aground for not paying attention (and high tide looks deceptively high!). Luckily a last second glance gets us out of danger.

Heading into the Thames channel from the Medway can be scary with the large container ships zipping past you and the ones just in the distance ready to pounce at a moment's notice. Channel markers are you friend in the Thames; that, the atlas. Pilotage into the Thames requires staying out of the way of much larger ships and towing vessels and avoiding what seems like an endless array of obstructions.

The wind is not good for us this day. We motor for most of it. At one point Phil asks if I packed a jerry can of fuel to which he responded, "naughty boy" for
