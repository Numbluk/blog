Title: "Is this it?"
---

I'm a manager now.

Honing soft-skills and paying attention to my team, it paid off somehow. I care about my direct reports, and their success. I'm happy I get to foster the careers of others and it might be the most impactful thing I do. The company doles out a reasonable part of my yearly package each month which I then bundle up using various tax-savings instruments and spend the rest on a mortgage and kids and chuck the rest in a pile and close the vault. In fact, I don't really care about the money. As long as I have a home, a healthy family, and _something_ else the money doesn't matter. 

I was an engineer.

I fixed problems, drove consensus across multiple teams, and mentored others to become technical leaders themselves. The company doled out a reasonable part of my yearly package each month which I then bundled up using various tax-savings instruments and spent the rest on a mortgage and kids and chucked the rest in a pile and closed the vault.
