Out of every comment I've ever read on HackerNews, I remember this one the most. It's funny how it's a quote of a quote of an unnamed author. Legends exist even in modern times. I'm sure time will go by and people say, "marvin never existed" and they'll this article as research, but in the end it won't be proof enough for X, Y, and Z.
