My biggest fear is looking back on my life and not creating something which matters. This is obviously a greater discussion of what matters and how it differs from person to person.

Out of every comment I've ever read on HackerNews, I remember this one the most. It's funny how it's a quote of a quote of an unnamed author. Legends exist even in modern times. I'm sure time will go by and people say, "marvin never existed" and they'll use this article as research, but in the end it won't be proof enough for X, Y, and Z.

I would sacrifice my job for my life. 

I've met people in my life who I will remember, however, it saddens me to think they will be lost to history once I'm gone. These are tragic stories of humans who never .

When I look back at my work life, I think about how I tackled complex projects, coordinated with teams to achieve goals, and encouraged and mentored team members to mature. That is to say, I just deliver food. Rather, I help people order food for a living.

Many might say you can reduce any work life achievements to meaninglessness. Let's go down the list:

- Hedge Fund: you play with fake money for the sake of getting more fake money
- Twitter: you create tiny little blogs where 99.9999% of them have no value
- Amazon: you offer at marketplace with terrible knock-offs at the expense of quality goods

There has to be a line somewhere. For instance, it'd be difficult to say "You're just a doctor who helps people moan" because it's a clear necessity. The size of an operation may also play a role. For instance, if you ran Twitter on your own would you still feel as though your output is meaningless? It's difficult to say because the output would likely be different: would Twitter with 1,000 staff be different with an engineer of 1? Probably. 

It's not about being a cog, it's about the output. I would be troubled if my legacy was Twitter because it's a menace to society. 

I see this as a threefold problem: mission, output, and creativity. The sweet spot is obviously excelling in all three areas, but that's rarely the case. 

1. Mission: If you are saving the world then 1 vs 1,000,000 staff makes little difference.
2. Output: The work you do. The classic "you're just a cog in you BigCorp, come join a startup where your output *will make a difference*"
3. Creativity: The amount of creativity leads to continual and obvious growth.

...

It's not about creating trees in a video game. It's about finding balance. 

Some crave complexity that only the trees in GTA 7 offer. Some will create the trees as a result of the task given to them because they have reward elsewhere in life. Some think good trees will provide an enlightened sense of reward to those who sit under the well-rendered oak trees as they stare up into a well-rendered moon in GTA 7.

We talk about drive. A few individuals are driven to do something. I think this is a lie. We are all driven, however, we don't always chase it because the balance isn't there.


## Move the following to a different blog post entitled "CRUD apps are hard"

I've often been afraid of not persisting after death. Not in relation to Heaven, but here on Earth. Many will say this is a prideful goal or a pointless one. When I dig deeper, I come to the conclusion that it's not persistence for the sake of it, but being remembered for something I did which meaningfully improved the lives of others. I care deeply about this. In fact, I had a draft blog post sitting idle for almost two years about "not wanting to write cruds apps for the rest of my life". Some might see the irony in me becoming a manager as many managers are famous for burning value over creating it on the path to the top. 

I will say that my perspective since becoming a manager has changed tremendously. Like some other managers, I miss the day-to-day technical work (if I could have it in my own way, that is). The core of what has changed has more to do with the fact that CRUD apps are hard. Doing something well is hard. Design matters a tremendous amount and this is what I've grown to care about the most. As long as I'm striving towards a goal, then that's what truly matters. At the very least, that's where I find meaning. There is beauty in well-crafted code, but the end-result gives it that transcendent experience.
