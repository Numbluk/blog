Around 8:52 PM:

On the top of my mind is being incredibly sick last night. I only puked twice, but had constant diarrhoea and didn't truly fall asleep for the night until 6:30 AM. Needless to say, I had no energy whatsoever today. Frances snuggled next to me and jumped on top of me as I took a nap around 3:00 PM and then Carolinagain at 4:30 PM; on any other day napping would mean I will struggle to fall asleep at night, but I'm confident I could go to sleep right now if I wanted.

I thought I had dodged a bullet, with Rosalind, Frances, and Caroline taking the worst of it, but I must have jinxed myself and have paid dearly for it. Eating anything that isn't plain is a struggle, but I'm hoping tomorrow is far better after a shower and a good night's sleep. The weather is due to be beautiful (23C!) so I'd really like to make the most of it.

I hate being sick. It may be only me who struggles to cope with nausea, but it lays me out flat. The lack of energy, the baseline cold mixed with hot flashes come any exertion, and not to mention the dreariness. All of this can suddenly put me in an unfriendly mood, especially when paired with two constantly screaming little girls. My patience has drastically improved since having Frances (thanks in large part to Caroline setting the best example), however, sometimes life is, well, tough. It's in these situations where I need to do ask for help instead of struggling through it which makes it worse for everyone and I usually end up with long-lasting pangs of regret.

Just before my stomach kicked off last night, I spoke to William for around one-and-a-half hours last night. He's not doing well. We spoke at length on purpose and Christianity. Over time, he has slipped into agnosticism which is a sad thing to see. From an outward perspective, he is struggling on many fronts: his marriage is on one a one-way street to a divorce, he feels he has no purpose, and his slippery foundations have led to some concerning comments regarding self-diagnosis of mental issues, etc.

William's struggles are the archetypal male struggle of the 21st century and I could spend an age talking about it, but I'll leave it for now. Just let it be known that I see his problems present in many, many men.

I got started on the Curriculum yesterday, but between chatting with William and being sick, I've had no time to consider it further.
