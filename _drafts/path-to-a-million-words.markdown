# Writing A Million Words In The Open

Goal: Describe what it is, why I'm doing it, and how I'll track it.

I want to bring you on a journey, my journey, to a million words. I doubt many will find it inspirational, but some may at least find it useful and that's something to write home about. 

My greatest desire is to craft sentences which cause that stir of emotion where someone leans over their friend's shoulder to say, "take a look at this, it's _good_". Things to chew on. Things to savour, but none of them banal. However in all this want for perfection there's a problem: I'm not so certain what good actually is.

Take the first paragraph as an example. Is it good? I can confidently say it's average. If I took a poll of everyone who read this and asked them what they remembered, it'd be something along the lines of, "they want to write one million words in order to write well" and I'd imagined they'd remember it simply because "one million" just so happens to be a lot of words, but not necessarily because it's any good. Here's another line to ponder:

> There once was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it.

Now _that_ is good writing, but unfortunately it's not mine, it's C.S. Lewis'. In fact, I think it's so good that I've committed it to memory even though I'm a philistine who has yet to read Chronicles of Narnia. I could elaborate on why I think it's good, but one could probably guess without me meandering through vague opinions with no authority, but hopefully I can reach that authority, just like any craft, over time.

I'm a native English speaker who has read quite a few classics and a good chunk of "good writing", but a 10-year old just out of his grammar class could teach me a thing or two about syntax. I plan to pre-empt this embarrassing run-in by finding more about what I don't know and I hope that will at least reinforce a foundation built on intuition.

I love cooking. I remember first discovering the science of cooking, but after a while realized that tradition and art separated an excellent cook from an armchair internet chef. With this in mind, I'll try and read as much good writing as possible and hopefully share my perception of it along the way. A daily dose of Michelin-starred writers and stories.

It's  going to be a long journey to write one million words no matter how you spin it. In fact, if we average out the number of words per day needed to get there, here's a chart to scare you away:

| Word Count | Days to 1 Million | Years to 1 Million |
-------
| 250 | 4000 | 10 |
---
| 500 | 2000 | 5 |
---
| 1000 | 1000 | 2 |
---
| 5000 | 200 | 0.55 |
---
| 10,0000 | 100 | 0.27 |

That's correct, if you write 250 words a day it will take you **10 years** to reach one million. On the other hand, if you are Stephen King who famously write 10,000 words a day it will only take you 100 days. Based on the infinite monkey theorem, I'm surely going to churn at least one page of "good" by 1 million words.

I will probably lie somewhere between 250 and 10,000 words per day. At my current level of output, 250 is certainly manageable. Like anyone who gets better at their craft, I expect the daily average to creep up as time goes on. At the beginning, my timeline is certainly bleak, but as time moves on it will accelerate and before you know it I'll have enough to print off and create a celebratory bonfire.

As for the tools, I don't use writing apps, just a good 'ole text editor. At the moment I use GhostWriter because it's free as in Open Source, allows me to write with Markdown, and I generally hate distraction. I take pleasure in the manual process of taking count--the act of writing down a start number and subtracting it from the final tally to get my daily count so I can log it in a spreadsheet--is refreshing. I'm a miser for words.

A final note must be made about editing. Within software engineering, the Pareto Principle runs rife, that is to say the concept of 20% of the work taking 80% of the time is constantly lurking behind every software project and try as I may, it sometimes swamps you and drags you into the muck before you can rid yourself of it. My guess is that editing will take the same shape: editing will take 80% of the time, but like everything else I hope I can share my learning journey here as well.

Acknowledging the editing dilemma, I want to be honest and say that my total published output will not be 1 million words, but my total personal output will be. I will definitely save version of my writing to use as historical comparisons of and (hopefully) a progression of editing skills, but I'll only publish them if someone in this world finds them useful. In conclusion, I want people to actually read my blog and I'm a huge fan of operating in the open, but there are limits to people's sanity.

I wrote 250 words per day for the past two days and 904 words today. Only 999,096 more to go.
