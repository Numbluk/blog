The second-to-last train out of London was empty and I knew it. By the time the train reached the salt marsh flats, the carriage's air was filled with smeared evaporating footsteps of the previous travellers. 

A lurch in the tracks jammed open a window and the thick wet air that slowly fed the cavern made things worse, as if the air outside had congealed for a hundred years and created a wall between me and the City. 

The thick, yellow paper 

I stepped off the train onto Burnham Station into a crowd of punters who sloshed their "excuse me"s as they took my place on the train and repainted the train with wet footsteps. As I watched the train take off, I immediately recognised a man with long grey hair dozing amongst the drunken yelling and grating wheels.

"Asleep already, Tom?" I said, over the noise.

The man's eyes immediately opened, "James?"	

He jumped up and was shaking my hand before I knew it, "I was starting to worry I'd miss you when I fell asleep."

"Luckily for you, the air threatened to suffocate me as soon as I entered the valley, so it was a fight for survival or sleep; I almost wish I'd taken the latter. How do you do it?" I asked.

Tom led out of the concourse onto the road. "It's not always like this, you know--besides, even I got used to it. Most importantly, you're here and I'm happier for it."

"You mean _they_ are happier for it", I said. 

Tom paused before a lone car waiting to turn before continuing, "Well, yes. But you can certainly single me out if you'd like. Also, they have every right to be, a thousand years is a long time."

"Yes, yes it is" I said. 

There was no noise until it was upon you, as if someone waited until you were within arms distance and decided to let the jack-in-the-box pop. Even when it was obvious. The auras of the street lamps were big puffs of white, rounded by night and air; there was no light to give. The restaurant-goers clung to the door fronts and the pubs were loudly silent, albeit busy.
 
The high street itself was long, we took the same path all the way to the heart of the town.

"How close are we?" I asked.

"Only a small way to go, let's turn here" and he signalled towards what I took for the quay.

As soon as we turned, the wind beat us both back and I was thankful for the suit.  

I could see the faint glow of the City even from this far away, but the thunderheads blistering into existence with bursts of lightning only reinforced the dark of the North Sea. As we sped along, Tom pointed to a 1920s art deco building whose white facade stuck out even in the dark, "There it is."

"I took the group for something... older." I said.

"Reasonable, but consider what stands after a thousand years. As low as your expectations are, you may be pleasantly surprised."

As we approached the building, the flood of wind was replaced by a flood of tweed: men in groups of all sizes were heading towards the building. The punters who looked out onto the quay didn't seem to notice or care when they did.

We reached the front door of the building and I had to crane my neck to see the top. Looking back at the town, it was both ostentatious and uncaring it was so: it all made sense. 

The guard knew everyone by name. His sentences rolled out each name as if remembered from childhood, "Felix", "John", "Paul". When it came our turn to force the flood through the doors, the guard nodded to both of us and let us in, "Tom. James." 

We followed the crowd through a set of doors (doors that block wind?) into a single room. The room itself was, in fact, a medieval hall.

Above the conversation and noise I asked, "How is this possible? Is this real? The building sticks out over the river." 

I could see Tom laugh as he said, "It certainly is a marvel, but nothing time couldn't make possible."

We were both offered and accepted wine before Tom continued, "As I said earlier, nothing here is a thousand years old. Except what you see. And what what you see is a perfectly encased medieval hall."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing, "How have you gotten away with it? Surely the locals must have suspected."

"Some of us are locals which helps sow the ever popular idea that most architecture post-1910 is useless. Not a difficult thing to convince people, mind you, as for myself I have a soft spot for--"

Tom's conversation trailed off in my mind as I floated from person to person to ceiling to table to fireplace to wall. Before I could take an ounce of it in, groups parted all the way from the entry door to the end of the hall as someone walked to the head of the table and as they did conversations began to fall away until the only sound was the man making his way towards the end of the table. It was the guard. 

I looked around and when I realised I was the only one doing so, I focused my attention back to the guard. Unlike everyone else, he had no cup in his hand. Instead, he spread his arms wide and bellowed, "Welcome!"

"Our little event is well underway and I'm happy to see each and every member attending tonight. I'm especially happy for out guests who have no doubt been offered the best hospitality by Pierre." He gestured to a man in the corner who paid no mind to what he said as he was too busy dealing with logistics. 

"Before we get started, I want to remind you of the order of service. I'll first say a few words about our history, then Tom has kindly volunteered to introduce our guest of honour, and if it isn't too much to task, the guest of honour will share with us a very special item on this momentous occasion." He waited for Tom's nod before continuing.

"As all of us know, it has been one thousand years since the first member of our organisation put together a "
