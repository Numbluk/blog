Around 9:06 PM:

Work is returning to some sense of normalcy again. We're hiring for two more candidates and it finally feels like we can start moving somewhere. I'm hoping the team feels passionate enough about our vision that we can keep people on board. I have a feeling that the young age of the team has meant they have a distorted view of a company treating their employees "unfairly". By all accounts, Deliveroo is a great company to work for in terms of life balance and compensation. So much so, that I'm afraid that I won't be able to find it again if it I'm forced to leave.

I started reading Bloom's *How to Read and Why* last night. While his insight is certainly valuable, I'm afraid I won't be reading too much of the book as I don't want any spoilers. Instead, I'm going to use the book as a reference for what to read next year during my curriculum. Today I almost purchased a book or two mentioned in the text, but refrained because I wanted to keep hold on the anticipation for the road before me.

Tonight I'm going to spend fifteen minutes working on an outline for the Curriculum. I'll report back tomorrow on the progress. Part of me wants to get started with *A Student's Introduction to English Grammar* immediately, so I may start putting an hour towards it everyday starting tomorrow.

Caroline and I have been discussing the issue of the Kids being forced to receive topics of education in this country the past few days. I think we've both settled on the fact that it's not a major concern for the next year or two, but after that we should have a settled place in mind to send our children to so that we can live a simple life and not worry about the false enrichment of our children's minds. 

If money were no issue, I would be the Kids' tutor. Unfortunately, I can only do my best to help them see the world's landscape through a wide open and joyous lens.

Recently, I saw someone on Reddit mention "manifestation". I think what he was getting at was the concept of willing certain outcomes into the fabric of one's destiny. When I look back on my life, it's hard not to think that this exists. I think about the dreams of castles, ivy-covered stone walls, ancient manicured grounds, and a gathering of children who were passionate about finding truth in a heavenly setting from the greats who lived before us. I think about how I've come to be where I am and how I could very well live close to this fantasy while providing this to my own children. I truly wish I could give these feelings to them and transport them to a place where they thrive and find beauty, but I'm not confident in my ability to permanently give them this experience. The thrust of stress upon my shoulders with the idea of spending £20k a year per children until they are eighteen is difficult to bear.

Taxes in this country are discouraging beyond belief. If we were to take everything net, we'd be making around £156,000 a year between Caroline and I—that is almost £100,000 in taxes! The lack of serious corporate taxes in this country means the middle is squeezed to death. It's sad that I even consider myself a middle income earner, but it makes sense when one considers the cost of childcare, the cost of saving for a retirement, and the cost of housing in the Home Counties. If we end up with four children, this would mean £1.1 million in private school fees over the Kids' lifetime! which doesn't even include college or supporting them beyond further in life. These extreme costs of living have also pushed me towards considering the USA as an option; at least there I can trust that my kids can be pushed to succeed if they wish to be at a state school.

Who knows. Maybe we'll drop right into the lottery winnings of life.
