title: "Exploring the mentality of just building it"
---

I'm going to do it. I'm going to build a piece of shit and not think twice. On second thought, I'll do it once a month for twelve. 

Output, output,	output. 

I've seen others commit for twelve months and find great success; I've seen others fall on their face. People create games once a month. People create businesses once a month. I'm sure others have done something similar: run a marathon a month, go to church once a month, and maybe even sail the English Channel once a month, luckily enough the possibilities are endless so hopefully building what will most likely be piles of shit will only add to the kaleidoscope.

Goodbye games. Goodbye reading list. It pains me to say it, but I've got to move the needle on something, right? 

I'm in the business of business, so I'll likely push out a bunch of shitty business ideas. 

I'll keep everyone updated. Remember people, SMART goals:

- Specific: Launch a crappy business idea once a month.  
- Measurable: Create at least one customer flow per idea.
- Achievable: Yes.
- Relevant: Yes, they will all touch the north star.
- Time-Bound: One month each. No more, no less. The follow-up on these might be greyer e.g. what if one idea builds momentum?

For transparency, I'll make everything clear here:

- Language/Stack: Ruby on Rails. This is a no-brainer. Not only is it my bread and butter, but it's the 300lb gorilla of startups. No one in their right mind would try and ship a React+API as a starting point. 
- Platform: Render. Goodbye Heroku.
- Time constraints: I have a family. I also have free time in the evenings and sometimes during the day on weekends. When people say how they've done a one-idea-a-month, they never really say how long each day they spent. I'll be absolutely transparent about that.

Like anyone else starting from scratch, it will likely be slow going from the get-go as I flounder my way through setting up a template to use going forward. To avoid being too slow in the beginning and giving too much weight to the earlier ideas, I'll be 

- Is it worth wrapping everything together towards a north star target? In other words, what if the focus is on the north star rather than "12 business ideas"?
- What legacy do I want to leave?
- Mention:
	+ Practice. The first product will be slow going. 
	+ I'm a Rails developer and I need to automate some things.
	+ I have time constraints: I've got a family, but free time in the evenings and some during the day on the weekends.
	+ I'll need to automate a lot of things and reuse some settings across the board.
	+ I'll only use a PAAS across the board and use design templates.
	+ Things I'll need to do up front:
		* Find design templates or use something VERY bare bones
		*
