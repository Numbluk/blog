I'm considering waking up early again. My usual destructive pattern of a late night snack and watching YouTube puts me at 10:00 PM before I do anything productive, if at all. 10:00 PM is more than late and it doesn't leave time to read as I'll tend to fall asleep quickly. I had a burst of inspiration at around 3:00 PM today, but I didn't follow through in the evening; it's funny how doubts can get the best of you sometimes.

I'm thinking about getting rid of the boat. The expense has become enormous without having dedicated crew. So much for 10% a year... Additionally, I find the mental toll to be almost more than I can bear at times. When I'm out at sea, the lack of mental fortitude can cause me to panic and fear the worst: never seeing my girls again. As I always tell Caroline: I could live a life of very little and be okay. I'll admit, sailing is quite the sport, however, it's costly and potentially ruinous which makes it adventurous, but sometimes that burden is huge when you're away for a long stretch of time. I wonder if I should give it all up and take up gardening or cooking? Which brings me to my next thoughts...

I'm considering writing a food blog. Crazy, right? Even worse, I'm thinking about building it from scratch. Everyone says, "just write" and "don't build it yourself" and "everyone does this and that because of SEO", however, I see this as an opportunity to single myself out. 

Every food blog is the exact same formula: long back story, intrusive ads popping up which causes the page to jump around, and then the actual content (the recipe). I want to make _real_ content. I want to be the anti food blog food blog. I want to cook books, but I want to do it in style and with a voice that brings life to cooking and the current state of food blogs on the web. There's an up front investment: blog construction, intuitive design, cook book breakdown, photography, advertising and marketing, and then to top it all off the writing and cooking plan. It's a lot of effort with not a lot of gain, so it would have to be a true labour of love. My goal is to be a great cook and I want to see where I can get in a concentrated period of time, so starting a blog seems like a good way to force this to happen.  My initial thoughts are thus:

- Cook through the entirety of "The Food Lab" at least within a year (I need to see the stats)
- Discuss the blog in the open and its development
- Criticise the current state of food blogs
- Focus on areas of differentiation: design, speed, and content
