# October 15th

I'm in my office on Crouch Road,
Listening to Erik Satie's Gymnopedies,
And it's around 10:21 PM:

As I was saying yesterday, I've been having a better idea of what I want for future. I would like to be free of all tethers to any city, and especially London, and, most of all, be the captain of my own destiny in terms of my life's monetary success.

All my life I have struggled to put this into words, and I could still do better, but even before I went to college I recall feeling that it wasn't for me. I wanted to define my own destiny and my own success on my own terms. Obviously, things turned out differently, however, in the end I was able to make a step closer with dropping out of college. Dropping out of college is the riskiest decision I have ever made so far: $90,000 in debt, no degree, and no qualifications are not a recipe for success. I've made it work so far and I've achieved such a financial success that many in this world would envy, however, the money is not enough.

As I've made more money, the less it's mattered; money, the vanity of vanities.

It's the soul. The soul is the undercurrent which has driven me here. And its my soul which is driving me away from the city and its inhabitants, away from excess which will suck you in and spit you out at 65 with a safe retirement, "cultured" children long gone to explore themselves in faraway lands, and nothing but the sound of tires peeling away with your iPhone 23 and away from the warm red blanket spreading over your chest. 

Reverse the clock over 30 years and I could have made another choice. I will make another choice. Even if it means leaving this God forsaken country for another; I'll make my family safe and happy. I can do with nothing but the Great Stories of the past and the great stories in my head if my family are close, healthy, and with a soul.

My thoughts are taking a shape, but they aren't all there. Excuse the next few diaries while I focus.

In other news, we had a long ride back from Esmond Road today. We left late and the Girls had a late nap, but both of them went to bed without any trouble. I love the. so much. 

Tomorrow will be the start of getting up early, although in steps. I'm going to get up at 6:45 AM to begin working on the grammar book.
