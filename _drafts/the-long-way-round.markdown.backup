- Don't take the highway. Illustrate with a recent example of England.
- Talk about the worst place on earth for roads: Houston
- How do you convince someone not to talk the beaten path without sounding cheesy? How do you show them the value?
- Let's take a local who has never left. Ever. The same walk everyday for the past forty years. What are they missing?
- A -> B is boring. Everyday. People in big cities love to talk about being exposed to culture in their middle class bubbles of 20 who all went to the school and make roughly the same amount of money. They criticize the local. "He's not seen the world" how could he know anything?
- They are both missing something. It's just out of reach.

Is the Metropolitan Man a conversation between someone from London and Jaywick? What about the middleman? You cannot sink, you can only grow. 

Jaywick and "never say die".

Q: Who cares? What's the moral?
A: Is it to illustrate hypocrisy? To simply classify? What about the local man? 



The Metropolitan Man is European first (comment about only 10/50 countries), British second, and never English.
